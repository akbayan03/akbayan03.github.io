            You can take a scenic train ride to the hill country, winding through lush tea plantations. Sri Lankan tea (or Ceylon Tea) is known to be the finest in the world, garden fresh and produced with the utmost care. You can also take an informative tour around popular tea factories located in the central highlands and taste some of the fine unblended teas.<br><br>
            Enjoy the traditional Sri Lankan cuisine made with the finest ingredients of local spices and herbs. The small island is a popular exporter of a variety of spices. Sri Lanka’s ‘Ceylon Cinnamon’ is world-renowned for its unique flavour, colour and aroma. The white and green varieties of cardamom pods grown here makes delectable dishes.<br><br>
            The multi-ethnic population in the country embraces cultural diversity and are well-known amongst tourists to be warm, hospitable people.<br><br>
